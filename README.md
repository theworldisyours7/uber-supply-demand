# uber-supply-demand

 Project Summary
This project analyzes Uber ride request data to identify imbalances between customer demand and driver availability. By leveraging Excel for data cleaning and dashboard creation, SQL for database-level insights, and Python (Pandas) for advanced exploratory data analysis, we uncover the key patterns contributing to unfulfilled ride requests.

The project helps stakeholders visualize and understand when and where Uber is failing to meet customer demand — especially during peak hours and at specific pickup points such as the Airport. Data-driven recommendations are provided to improve resource allocation and reduce unmet requests.

Problem Statement
Uber often faces a supply-demand mismatch during peak hours and at specific locations. This results in:

A large number of cancellations,

No cars available errors, and

Customer dissatisfaction and churn.

Without clear insights into when and where these issues occur, operational teams struggle to manage driver allocation and optimize supply efficiently.

 Business Objective
The main business goals of this project are to:

Identify demand-supply gaps by analyzing trip request data.

Determine peak demand hours and locations (e.g., Airport vs. City).

Quantify the volume of unmet demand due to cancellations or no availability.

Provide actionable insights to help Uber:

Deploy drivers more efficiently,

Improve availability during peak hours,

Increase ride completion rate,

Enhance user satisfaction and reduce lost revenue.

 Tools & Technologies Used
Tool	Purpose
Excel	Data cleaning, pivot tables, dashboards
SQL	Insightful queries on ride data
Python (Pandas)	Exploratory data analysis, visualizations

Key Outcomes
Found that peak hours (5–9 AM & 5–9 PM) had the highest demand gaps.

Airport pickups faced more No Cars Available issues.

Suggested dynamic pricing, driver incentive schemes, and demand forecasting as business solutions.
